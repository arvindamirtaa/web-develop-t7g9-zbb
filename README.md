# Peer Graded Assignment

## Purpose of Site
The first and foremost reason for a theme park operator to have a website is the easy online promotion so that more and more people get know about the theme park as whenever someone searches theme park on a search engine there are chances that the site will show up and people will get to know about it and it acts as promotion medium for him. Secondly, people will get to know more about the theme park, like which rides are in the park and other things that are special to the park. Also, people can get to know about the ticketing system of the park and the website can be designed to allow online bookings which makes it easier for people as they get to skip the long waiting lines and get direct entry which will attract more visitors and when people get to know about the park and book everything sitting at their homes, more and more people would visit the park and increase its popularity.
